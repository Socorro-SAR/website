    <h1 align="center">2014 Missions</h1>
    <div align="center">
      <p>Many teams and incident base staff have participated in the     following missions. In our area there are other great teams that   regularly   participate in missions. What we have reported here is what   we saw and in no way   do we intend to take full credit for any of these   missions.      </p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Mission #: 14-11-01<br />
      Date: March 10, 2011 <br />
Location: 15 miles west of Truth or Consequences, NM<br />
Subject: Group of 6 Backpackers</strong><br />
<br />
A Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) activation was detected approximately 15 miles west of Truth or Consequences, NM for a group of 6 backpackers. The Air Force Rescue Coronation Center (AFRCC) provided the initial coordinates of the PLB and teams were callout. While teams were en-route to the area an updated set of coordinates was received and it was discovered the initial set of coordinates were incorrect. The actual coordinates placed the group in a very remote area of the Gila Wilderness over 50 miles from the initial coordinates. At that time the decision was made to turn around ground resources and allow the New Mexico National Guard Blackhawk handle the mission. Shortly after the updated coordinates were received the subjects discovered that the PLB was malfunctioning inside a backpack and called their group HQ to alert them of the situation. At that point the mission was ended while all teams were in route home</p>
 <p align="left"><strong>Mission #: 14-11-02<br />
      Date: March 24, 2014 <br />
Location: Westside of Ladron Peak, Socorro County, NM<br />
Subject: Male Hiker</strong><br />
<br /> 
A 48 yo male hiker was reported missing by his girlfriend on the night of March 23 after he failed to return from a day trip to hike Ladron Peak. NMSP with the help of the Socorro County Sheriff Department located the subject's vehicle around 04:00 on March 24th and teams were called out. The decision was made to start the search at first light. At 07:00 teams met and drove into the subject's vehicle. By 09:30 the first teams were in the field. At 10:30 the decision was made to request the NMSP helicopter ABLE 6 due to the size of the search area and lack of ground resources. Ground resources concentrated on the west side of Ladron Peak and were able to pick up the subjects tracks going up the mountain. At 13:07 ABLE 6 arrived in the search area and was tasked to search from the Peak west. At 13:10 ABLE 6 spotted a person matching the description of the subject and then confirmed that they were the subject. The subject was found outside of the primary search area on a road. A vehicle was sent to pick the subject up. Mission was concluded at 14:45. The subject had minor dehydration and the soles of his boots had separated. After a quick medical evaluation at Incident Base the subject was release after refusing further medical care.</p>

Subject: Male and Female Rock Climbers</strong><br />
<br /> 
 On Saturday, April 5, there was a bouldering competition in the Box Canyon Area of Socorro County, NM.  After the competition, a group of participants decided to camp overnight.  Between 16:30 and 17:30 on Saturday April 5 a 23 yo male and 21 yo female from the group were seen walking away from the main group area with only a crash pad and the cloths on their backs.  When the two subjects had not returned on the morning of Sunday, April 6 the remainder of their group contacted NMSP and a mission was initiated.  Incident Base was established at 14:00 in the box canyon area near where the subjects had last been seen.  Two hasty teams were put into the field in the area where the subjects were last seen.  At 15:45, the subjects were located in a cave 300 yards from Incident Base by a team conducting sound sweeps.  The subjects were in good health and were released from incident base to go home.  </p>
