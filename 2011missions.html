      <p>Many teams and incident base staff have participated in the     following missions. In our area there are other great teams that   regularly   participate in missions. What we have reported here is what   we saw and in no way   do we intend to take full credit for any of these   missions.      </p>

Socorro SAR responded to a mission to locate a single male subject who   had been missing for 18 days. The subject's vehicle was found near mile   marker 63 on January 10th or 11th. SSAR team members and other SAR   volunteers search the area around where the subject's vehicle was found.
